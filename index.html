        <h2>Welcome to Strathmore University!</h2>
        <p>
            Strathmore University is a chartered university based in Nairobi, Kenya.[2]

             Strathmore College was started in 1961, as the first multi-racial,<br> 
             multi-religious advanced-level sixth form college offering science and arts subjects, <br>
             by a group of professionals who formed a charitable educational <br>
             trust (now the Strathmore Educational Trust). Saint Josemaría Escrivá, <br>
             founder of Opus Dei, inspired and encouraged them to start the college. <br>
             It is a Catholic university. Strathmore has a particularly successful <br>
             accounting program: 60% of the CPA finalists in Kenya come from it in the past <br>
             ten years, dating back from 2007.[clarification needed] <br>
